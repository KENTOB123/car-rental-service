                  Comparing rental car deals is important as it helps find the
                  best deal that fits your budget and requirements, ensuring you
                  get the most value for your money. By comparing various
                  options, you can find deals that offer lower prices,
                  additional services, or better car models. You can find car
                  rental deals by researching online and comparing prices from
                  different rental companies.

                  In some states, you can rent a car at the age of 18; however, the legal age to rent a car in most states is 25 years old. You may rent a car at some locations between the ages of 21-24 for an additional young renter surcharge. Check the policies at the car rental location you&apos;re interested in renting from for that state&apos;s renter requirements.

                  Any additional driver (excluding a spouse or domestic partner) will pay a daily fee. Renter&apos;s spouse or domestic partner who meet the same age and driver&apos;s license requirements of the renter are authorized drivers at no additional charge. Any additional authorized drivers must appear at time of rental and meet age and driver&apos;s license requirements. 

An additional charge of $15.00 per day for each additional authorized driver will be added to the cost of the rental, unless other contractual conditions apply.  In New York state, the additional authorized driver charge is $5 per day.
